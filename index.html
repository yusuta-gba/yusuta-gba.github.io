<br> Hello I am a Computer Scientist, </br>

<br>  Because of Parallel-Computing  I am existing at the Hoenn-Region and called with 
    the name Allen. </br>
<br> That is: Abra's  * * * T E L E P O R T A T I O N * * *  </br> 
    
<br> x = 2 * 5 </br>
<br> y = 4 * 5 </br>
(f(f(x)) * g(g(y)) / 20  <p> &#8596;</p> f(f(x) * g(y)) </br>
